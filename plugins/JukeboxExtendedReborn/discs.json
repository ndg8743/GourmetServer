      "The original 30 second video for Itt Van A Gumimaci, the Hungarian version of I Am A Gummy Bear, debuted on the internet in August of 2006. It quickly went viral, gaining hundreds of thousands of views as the popularity of this catchy song and funny character increased and spread by word of mouth. A 30 second English version was then created which helped to increase the clip's popularity and views rocketed up into the millions. By the summer of 2007, the final full length 2:30 version was released and it has been gaining views and viewers ever since."
